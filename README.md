## Pixel Room Game ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ‚âœ¨
It's a very short browser pixel room / game where you can move the player across the room with left click / hold of the mouse.

I watched the [Build a Dev Portfolio as a 2D Game â€“ JavaScript Course](https://youtu.be/wy_fSStEgMs?si=toAOqTloGrgCh0yh) video to help with it. All the assets I've used can be found in the link of this video, also in [this repo](https://github.com/JSLegendDev/2d-portfolio-kaboom).
I've changed the player to whatever I needed, added some assets to the tileset in [Pixel Studio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1204050/Pixel_Studio__pixel_art_editor/), modified the map in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and made dialogue changes.
In the tutorial, [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) is used as the library to make the game. Since it has been deprecated, I've used [Kaplay.js](https://kaplayjs.com/) instead.
